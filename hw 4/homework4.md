### Please write a short summary of what the author means with the statement *Probability does not exist.*
In saying so, the author hopes to makes us realise that probability should not be thought of as a tangible value that can be univerally agreed upon. Rather, uncertainty and probability has to do with our personal beliefs and opinions that inform our understanding of probability and uncertainty of things. This is not to say that probability does not exist, but each person can have their own ideas of probability.

### Please write a short summary of what it means to *organize beliefs*.

By organizing our beliefs in an effective and concise manner, we can better understand our relationships with them and therefore, be aware of how they affect our uncertainties. The author points out that organizing beliefs does not mean figuring out what the correct beliefs are but being able to manage them in a way that helps us make better decisions.
